# FoxBot-GPT

A (bad) idea I had a few years ago, where the building blocks (RAG with vectorDBs, AI LLM, coding skills) are finally at a stage where I can pursue creating it.

Basically, the goal of this is to create a discord bot that interacts with/in discord servers as if it were a normal person. This means it can learn to like, detest, and will grow to prefer servers and users more than others.
